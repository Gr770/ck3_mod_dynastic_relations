# Changelog

## v1.2

* Improved performance and reduced memory usage.
* Actions will only have a dynastic relation impact if both participants are inside the diplomatic range of the player (this, by itself, reduces drastically the total number of dynastic relations)
* Fixed issues with dynastic relation GUI not being properly updated in the character window
* Fixed issues with dynastic relation GUI not being properly updated in the dynasty view

## v1.1

* Dynastic relation impact of granting titles is now taking into account the number and tier of granted titles. 
* Revoke title is now taking account the tier of the title being revoked. 
* Added a new dynastic relation for trying to revoke a title (this happens when the revoke is declined) 
* War declaration impact on dynastic relation has been refactored, and it should now consider all possible scenarios. 
* Joining a war now degrades the dynastic relation with the primary defender/attacker depending on joiner being an attacker/defender.
* Improved character window and dynasty view GUI to be immediately updated when a dynastic relation changes.
